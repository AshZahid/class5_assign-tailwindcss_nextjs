            The universities with the best computer programmers are not the big names you might expect.

After a worldwide coding competition, HackerRank has produced a ranking of the 50 universities or schools producing the best coders in the world – and the results are surprising.

The top three institutions for coding are in Russia, China and Vietnam, while the top US university – the University of California, Berkeley – comes in fourth.

More than 5,500 students from 126 institutions around the world took part in the coding competition, and universities in the ranking are scored based both on the number of participants and their competition scores.

Only universities with at least 10 participants are included in the ranking.

The top 10 universities cover Canada, Russia, Ukraine, India, Sweden, Vietnam, China and the United States.

India is the best represented country in the ranking, with 22 individual institutions recognised for producing world-leading coders – making up almost half of the ranking. The US has only eight colleges in the ranking.

Chinese student Wentao Weng, who ranked as the 13th best coder in the world, started learning when he was just 11 years old. He now practises for about four hours a day during the week and most of the day on weekends.

Even though computer science isn’t on the curriculum at his school, he says: “We try to become one of the best coders among high school students to [get admission] into a good university.”
